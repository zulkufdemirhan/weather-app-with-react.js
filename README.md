# Weather-App-with-React.js
## This app was created for practice with React.js.
### The city name you enter in the application, you can learn the current weather conditions of that city and a picture specific to that city appears in the background.

#### I generally used Css and React.Js in the application.
#### CSS Properties: CSS Flexible Box Layout , CSS Transitions and Transforms , CSS Pseudo Elements and CSS Position Property
#### React.Js Properties : Axios Api , Click & Key events and Html Dom Events, Props and Component ..
